Home lab server hardware build. Will be using this build to setup VM's on a hypervisor to experiment with Windows and Linux server distributions.

For context I originally had an Alieware Auror R5 that was sitting around that I was going to use as the server. I wanted to case swap it, but the motherboard on that device has a proprietary connector that only work with that case, so I had to build this up a little bit. Most of these parts are originally from that device except for the motherboard.
